## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. Here is a detailed description of how blockchain-oracles-comparison integrates with major cryptocurrency exchanges for automated trading and portfolio management.

### Executive Summary

A **blockchain-oracles-comparison** service does **not** directly execute trades on centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance or Coinbase. Instead, it acts as a critical **data integrity and aggregation layer** for the *smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps)* that *do* perform the automated trading and management. Its primary role is to securely and reliably feed off-chain market data (e.g., prices, volumes) from these exchanges *onto the blockchain*, where automated logic can then act upon it.

Think of it this way:
*   **Exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken):** The source of market data and the venue for trade execution.
*   **Automated Trading Bots/DeFi Protocols:** The "brain" that makes decisions (e.g., "buy if price drops below X").
*   **Blockchain Oracles (like Chainlink):** The "senses" that provide the brain with verified, real-world information from the exchanges.
